# Check which certificate kubelet presents to auth as server

```
openssl s_client -connect localhost:10250 -showcerts
```

<summary>How it works</summary>


We can think of **s_client** as curl for TLS debugging. It performs the TLS handshake and prints everything it learns.
<code> -showcerts makes the server send the entire certificate chain.</code>

OpenSSL performs:

1. TCP connect
2. TLS ClientHello
3. ServerHello
4. Certificate
5. Certificate Verify
6. It then prints everything it saw.


### Useful info in the command output

##### Certificate chain

the output starts with certificate 0, which is the leaf (end-entity) certificate presented by the server.
Here, for example, 0 represents kubelet server certificate, and 1 is the self-generated CA certificate with which the server cert is signed

Subject (s:) = who the certificate belongs to
Issuer (i:) = who signed it 

```
Certificate chain
 0 s:CN = k8s-playground@1780987714
   i:CN = k8s-playground-ca@1780987713


 1 s:CN = k8s-playground-ca@1780987713
   i:CN = k8s-playground-ca@1780987713

```
A certificate chain is always ordered like this:

0  Leaf (server/client certificate)
1  Intermediate CA (if any)
2  Intermediate CA
...
n  Root CA (sometimes sent, sometimes omitted)

##### Subject and issuer

```
Server certificate
subject=CN = k8s-playground@1780987714
issuer=CN = k8s-playground-ca@1780987713
```

##### Acceptable client certificate CA names

<code>CN = kubernetes</code>

"If you want to authenticate with a client certificate, it must chain back to this CA."

##### Verify return code

0 = OK, trusted
19 = self-signed  <code>verify error:num=19:self-signed certificate in certificate chain</code>
20 = unknown CA
21 - unable to verify chain
