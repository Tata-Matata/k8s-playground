## Tracee

In production, you'd normally deploy it continuously on every node, collect its events, and send the useful ones into your security/observability pipeline. Daemonset

Labs:

- "Did somebody execute a shell inside a container?"
- "Did a container suddenly execute a suspicious binary?"

container: payments
execve("/tmp/x")

- "Did something attempt privilege escalation?"
setuid()
setgid()
capset()

- "Did a container attempt to access something unusual?"

/etc/shadow
/proc/...
/var/run/docker.sock


- "Did something attempt kernel/container escape techniques?"

You can monitor suspicious activity involving things such as:

ptrace
mount
unshare
setns
namespace operations
capabilities
kernel modules

- "Tell me when something looks suspicious."
Instead of receiving millions of raw events, Tracee can identify security-relevant behaviors.
You want something more like:

CRITICAL

Container attempted to access host filesystem

namespace: production
pod: payments-6c7...
container: payments
process: /bin/bash
event: ...

- Where does the output go?

Prometheus/Grafana/OpenSearch.
**Metrics** are good for:

number of security events
events per node
events per namespace
Tracee health

**Security** events

Tracee JSON events --> log/event pipeline --> Vector parse Tracee's JSON? --> OpenSearch --> OpenSearch Dashboards

Vector can:

parse Tracee's JSON
enrich events
filter noise
transform fields
route different event types
buffer events
send them to OpenSearch

2. seccomp amicontained RuntimeDefault  and Unconfined, custom Localhost profile
Compare output
It's especially nice because you can change the Pod's security context and observe the difference.

For example:

securityContext:
  seccompProfile:
    type: RuntimeDefault

versus:

securityContext:
  seccompProfile:
    type: Unconfined

Then run amicontained in each and compare what it reports.



3. apparmor profiles
Check whether AppArmor is enabled on your worker.
Create a tiny AppArmor profile.
Load it on the worker.
Run a pod using localhost/my-profile.
Verify /proc/self/attr/current.
Attempt an operation explicitly denied by the profile.
Observe the Permission denied.
Check the kernel/AppArmor logs.
Compare the experiment with a seccomp profile denying a syscall.
