### Types of admission controllers and their configuration


<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

There are **built-in admission controllers** that we can enable, disable and provide config for. And there are **custom admission webhooks** that we can implement, deploy and configure


#### built-in admission controllers

The list of enabled ones is specified in k8s PI server's

**--enable-admission-plugins=**

We can also provide configuration file path for them in

**--admission-control-config-file**

```
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:
  - name: PodSecurity
...
```
</details>

### PodSecurity as example of built-in admission controller

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Its job is to check Pods against the Kubernetes Pod Security Standards (PSS) when they are created or updated.

There are three security levels:

- privileged
- baseline
- restricted

For example, you can configure a namespace so that Pods must satisfy the restricted policy.

#### configuration file

For ex., at /etc/kubernetes/pod-security-config.yaml

```
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: AdmissionConfiguration

plugins:
  - name: PodSecurity
    configuration:
      apiVersion: pod-security.admission.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
      kind: PodSecurityConfiguration

      defaults:
        enforce: "restricted"
        enforce-version: "latest"

      exemptions:
        usernames: []
        runtimeClasses: []
        namespaces: []
```

#### tell kube-apiserver about this file

```
kube-apiserver \
  --enable-admission-plugins=PodSecurity \
  --admission-control-config-file=/etc/kubernetes/pod-security-config.yaml
```

#### What happens when you create a Pod?

```
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      securityContext:
        privileged: true
```

The request goes:

kubectl
   │
   ▼
kube-apiserver
   │
   ▼
PodSecurity admission controller
   │
   │ "Does this Pod satisfy restricted?"
   │
   ▼
   DENY


The Pod isn't persisted in etcd because the admission controller rejects the request.


#### Namespace-specific configuration

Different namespaces can have different levels of PSS and different modes

```
kubectl label namespace production  pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted

kubectl label namespace development \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=baseline \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit=restricted \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn=restricted
```

For development namespace it means:
- baseline violations are rejected
- resricted violations are recorded in audit and user gets warning

in modern Kubernetes, PodSecurity is **enabled by default** in the standard API-server admission-plugin set


</details>


### Check enabled admission plugins

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

If plugin is enabled because it is part of the API server's default admission-plugin set, it does not necessarily appear in --enable-admission-plugins in the static Pod manifest (or in ExecStart args if api server is deployed as service).

The Kubernetes API server has a compiled-in list of default admission plugins. PodSecurity is included in that default set in current Kubernetes versions.

You can see the defaults with:

```
kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins
```


</details>

### Custom admission plugin

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>


1. Develop application with an HTTPS endpoint that understands Kubernetes AdmissionReview requests.This API server receives an AdmissionReview object from K8s API server and must return an AdmissionReview response.

**Example request**

```
{
  "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
  "kind": "AdmissionReview",
  "request": {
    "uid": "12345",
    "operation": "CREATE",
    "object": {
      "kind": "Pod",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "test"
      },
      "spec": {
        "containers": [
          {
            "name": "nginx",
            "securityContext": {
              "privileged": true
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example Response**

```
{
  "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
  "kind": "AdmissionReview",
  "response": {
    "uid": "12345",
    "allowed": false,
    "status": {
      "message": "Privileged containers are not allowed"
    }
  }
}

```

K8s API server then rejects the Pod.


2. We can deploy webhook as Deployment on the cluster or a stand-alone app on an external server

3. If it is a Deployment - expose via Service

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: security-webhook
  namespace: admission-system
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: security-webhook
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: security-webhook
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: webhook
          image: myregistry/security-webhook:v1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8443
```

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: security-webhook
  namespace: admission-system
spec:
  selector:
    app: security-webhook
  ports:
    - port: 443
      targetPort: 8443
```



Now the API server can reach:

<code>security-webhook.admission-system.svc:443</code>

4. TLS
   
The API server normally communicates with admission webhooks over **HTTPS**. The webhook needs a certificate. The certificate needs to be valid for the Service DNS name, such as:

**security-webhook.admission-system.svc**

The K8s API server also needs to know which CA it should trust. That's where **caBundle** comes in (s. WebhookConfiguration below)

5. API server certificate and private key

This is implementation specific and not prescribed by K8s. A very common pattern is to put the certificate and key in a Kubernetes Secret and mount the secret into the webhook Pod

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: webhook-tls
  namespace: admission-system
type: kubernetes.io/tls
data:
  tls.crt: <certificate>
  tls.key: <private-key>

```

```
spec:
  containers:
    - name: webhook
      image: my-webhook:v1
      volumeMounts:
        - name: tls
          mountPath: /tls
          readOnly: true

  volumes:
    - name: tls
      secret:
        secretName: webhook-tls
```

6. Register the webhook by creating ValidatingWebhookConfiguration (or Mutating)

```
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: security-webhook
webhooks:
  - name: security.example.com

    clientConfig:
      service:
        name: security-webhook
        namespace: admission-system
        path: /validate
        port: 443

      caBundle: <CA-CERTIFICATE>

    rules:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        apiVersions: ["v1"]
        operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
        resources: ["pods"]

    admissionReviewVersions:
      - v1

    sideEffects: None

```
