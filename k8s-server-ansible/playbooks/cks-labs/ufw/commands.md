### What to be aware of when enabling ufw

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**ufw enable** means: Turn on the firewall and start enforcing the UFW rules. But you can add rules after ufw enable as well.

#### What to be careful about

Imagine you're connected to a remote server via SSH: ssh user@server

Then you do: **ufw enable**

If UFW's incoming policy is *deny*, but you haven't allowed SSH yet, your SSH connection can be blocked.

The safer sequence is:

```
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

sudo ufw enable

```

Now when UFW is activated:

SSH → allowed
HTTP → allowed
HTTPS → allowed
everything else incoming →  denied
outgoing →  allowed
