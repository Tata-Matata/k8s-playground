### Service mesh
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for managing **communication between services**.

Without a service mesh, your applications themselves have to deal with things like:

- TLS/encryption
- retries
- timeouts
- authentication
- traffic routing
- observability
- load balancing

A service mesh moves much of this networking functionality outside your application code. Typically, a proxy (Envoy) sits next to each application. The proxies communicate with each other.

### How mTLS is implemented

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```
Pod A -->  plaintext from application --> Istio sidecar --> mTLS encrypted --> Istio sidecar --> plaintext to application on Pod B.

```

The applications themselves don't need to implement TLS. The **Istio sidecars (Envoy)** handle the encryption/decryption.

#### Envoy 

Envoy is like a **network proxy** that Istio puts next to your Pod. The traffic gets intercepted by Envoy, and Envoy handles the network-level stuff. Istio commonly deploys an Envoy **sidecar container** into the same Pod as your application. They're separate containers, but they share the **Pod's network namespace**.

So with Istio sidecar injection, you'll often see something like:

```
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>


frontend   2/2     Running
backend    2/2     Running

```

### PeerAuthentication
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

PeerAuthentication is about how a workload accepts incoming traffic: “What kind of traffic will this workload accept from its peers?”

It is the **receiving** Pod's perspective. 

With:

```
mtls:
  mode: STRICT
```

the server says: "I will accept connections only if they come through Istio mTLS."

So:

```
client Envoy ──── mTLS ────> server Envoy ──> server container
                 ✓

```
but:

```
client ───── plaintext ─────> server
                 ✗
```

</details>

### Modes
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

We can think of the receiving workload as a **security guard**. 


##### Strict
only mTLS traffic is accepted. "Only authenticated/mTLS peers are allowed."

```
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

##### Permissive
accepts both mTLS and plaintext traffic. Useful during migration. 
"I'll accept either mTLS or plaintext."
You can have some clients already using sidecars/mTLS while others aren't.

```
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: PERMISSIVE
```

##### Disable
mTLS is not used.

```
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: DISABLE
```

</details>

### Namespace vs workload

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

#### namespace-wide policy

```
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: production
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```


#### target a particular workload

```
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: backend-mtls
  namespace: production
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```
